- "Peel off the parchment paper under the cake, and place it back under the cake. Spread the cream with raspberries on the cake to 2-3 cm from the edge, leaving the margin for the end. To roll the cake easily, make 4 or 5 shallow cuts in 2 cm intervals starting from the front of the cake and moving toward the back."
- "Remove the moisture from the raspberries with a paper towel, and sprinkle them over the cream. Roll it tightly, away from you, while using the parchment paper under the cake. Once rolled, allow it to rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours."

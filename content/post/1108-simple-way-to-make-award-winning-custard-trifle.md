recipeinstructions:

- "Now add this back to the simmering milk along with the condensed milk and keep stirring. Increase the heat to a high and keep stirring until desired thickness is attained. Take it off the heat. Let it cool down."
- "Chill this prepared custard in the refrigerator for an ample amount of time. Also set some Jello out of the store bought packs of your favourite flavours according to the package instructions."

- "In a serving bowl or shot glasses, arrange the cake pieces. Top that with the fruit layer. Finally top it up with the thick custard layer and the Jello pieces. Or else make it in a big serving dish and it will have similar 3 layers. The choice is all yours."
- "Enjoy it chilled!"

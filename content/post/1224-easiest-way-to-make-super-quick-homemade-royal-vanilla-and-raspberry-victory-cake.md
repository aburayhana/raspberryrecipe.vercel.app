Filled and topped with fresh juicy summer fruits, it makes an impressive centrepiece for any Slice the cake into three layers. Mix together the sugar syrup and liqueur and brush over the bottom and middle layers. And since a raspberry filling isn&#39;t quite enough, I had to add a bit more raspberry to the buttercream.

If you&#39;ve never made a Swiss.

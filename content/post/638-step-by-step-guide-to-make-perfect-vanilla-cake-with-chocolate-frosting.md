recipeingredient:
- " For the Vanilla Cake"
- "450 g cake flour"
- "480 g granulated sugar"
- "4 tsp baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "5 large egg whites at room temp"
- "1 whole egg at room temp"
- "170 g whole milk"
- "2 1/4 tsp vanilla extract"
- "170 g unsalted butter cold"
- " For the Frosting"
- "1 1/2 cups heavy cream"
- "112 g unsalted butter"
- "1/3 cup light corn syrup"
- "450 g semi sweet chicolate"
- "1 tsp vanilla"
- " Raspberry preserves if desired"
- " Berries if desired"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the oven to 175C. Butter and dust with flour 2 cake pans (about 8inch/20cm ones)"
- "Whisk together the egg whites, whole egg, milk, and vanilla. Set aside."
- "In another bowl (a big one), mix all dry ingredients: flour (be sure to sift this), sugar, baking powder, salt. Whisk together until well combined."
- "Chop up the 170g of cold butter into pieces. Add to the dry ingredients above. Use an electric mixer on low to combine the butter and dry ingredients until it makes a fine, crumbly texture. Just a tip: use a spoon and force the cold butter towards the mixer as you work, it will speed up the process a bit."
- "Add the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients in two batches. Mix until light and fluffy. Be sure to scoop down the sides and bottom of bowl to be sure all dry and wet ingredients are incorporated together."
- "Divide better evenly into the pans. Bake until the cake tester comes out with a few crumbs when inserted into the centre - about 30minutes (start on 25 and work from there!) When its done, take it out and let it cool for 20minutes before removing cake from the tins. Let it cool COMPLETELY before frosting."
- "While baking, make the frosting."
- "FROSTING: combine cream, butter, corn syrup in a saucepan and bring to simmer over low heat. Remove from heat and whisk once to make sure the butter has melted."
- "Add in the chocolate. Shake the pan to make sure the chocolate is covered and let stand for 5 minutes."
- "Whisk the mixture smooth and whisk in the vanilla."
- "Scrape frosting into a bowl and chill until it&#39;s spreadable (usually 30-45minutes). If it gets too hard to spread, break it into pieces and stir in a bowl over a boiling pot of water."
- "Once the frosting is ready to be spread, assembly the cake!"
- "ASSEMBLY: place one cake on cookie sheet/table/cake stand. If you want to use raspberries, spread the preserve on the cake, followed by fresh raspberries, halved. Then spread some frosting on top until fully covered, about 2ml thick! If you aren&#39;t using raspberries, just use frosting. Place the other cake on top."
- "Spread the rest of the chocolate frosting all over the cake until fully covered!"
- "If you see some crumbs peaking through, no worries. You can place the cake in the refrigerator for about 30minutes until the frosting has set. Then you can add another layer of chocolate frosting all of the cake as the &#34;final coat&#34;! Decorate and enjoy! ðŸ˜Š"

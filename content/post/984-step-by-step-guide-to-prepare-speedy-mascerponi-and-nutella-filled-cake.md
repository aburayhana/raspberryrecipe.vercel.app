Combine the flour, cocoa, sugar vanilla and ¾ cup sugar. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer for 1 minute until foamy.  Add the remaining sugar (3/4 cup) to the egg whites and continue beating until whites hold soft peaks. Add the flour mixture, to the egg whites, one third at a time, and mix until the batter is fully incorporated.

Refrigerate.   Cut 2.5cm/1 inch slice horizontally off top of the cake. Tear out some of the sponge cake, creating a tunnel and leaving 2.5cm/1 inch shell on the bottom.

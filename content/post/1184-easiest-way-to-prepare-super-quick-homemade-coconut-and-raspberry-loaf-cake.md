recipeingredient:
- " loaf cake"
- "150 grams unsalted butter"
- "150 grams golden caster sugar"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "3 medium eggs"
- "250 grams self raising flour"
- "100 grams desiccated coconut"

- " icing"
- "80 grams icing sugar"
- "2 tsp raspberry jam"
- "2 tsp hot water"
- " topping"
- "2 tbsp desiccated coconut"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 180C fan/160C gas mark 4. Grease a 900g loaf tin. Beat the butter, sugar and vanilla together until fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time with a little of the flour (this is important as it helps stop the mixture splitting)."
- "Fold in the coconut, remaining flour and milk. Spoon 3/4 of the cake mix into the tin and top with the jam (not too close to the edges). Spoon the rest of the mix on top."
- "Bake for 35 minutes, cover and return to the oven for another 20-25 minutes until just cooked and just golden. (You might need to adjust the times for your oven, I had to cover mine after 20 minutes because the top was cooking too quickly)."
- "Leave to cool. Mix together the icing ingredients, drizzle the icing over the cake and sprinkle the coconut on top."

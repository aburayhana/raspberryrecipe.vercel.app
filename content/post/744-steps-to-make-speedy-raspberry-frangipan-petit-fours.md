recipeingredient:
- "35 oz Almond paste  room temperature"
- "17 1/2 oz Butter  room temperature"
- "17 1/2 oz Eggs  room temperature"
- "2 1/2 oz Cake flour"
- " Filling"
- "3 cup Raspberry Preserves"
- " Glaze"
- "15 oz White chocolate can used colored candy wafers"
- "3 lb Confectioners sugar"
- "8 1/4 oz Light corn syrup"
- "6 oz Hot water"
- "3 tsp Vanilla extract"
- "1 as needed Food coloring"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cream the almond paste to soften (about 5 min on 2nd speed). Add the butter gradually until completely incorporated with no lumps."
- "Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well in between each addition. Scrape often.  Blend in the flour last."
- "Divide the batter evenly into 3 FLAT sheet pans lined with either cut parchment or silicone mats, which should also be lightly greased or sprayed with cooking spray."
- "Bake for about 12-15 minutes at 325•F    OR until light golden brown and set."
- "Cool and also freeze for easier handling."
- "After cooled, invert one layer onto the back of a FLAT sheet pan lined with parchment. Spread a paper thin layer of preserves onto the layer."
- "Invert the second layer onto the first and spread another thin layer of jam. Then, invert the third layer onto the top."
- "Freeze layered cake and cut desired shapes frozen. (Makes a nicer edge and the layers hold together much nicer when frozen) keep frozen until ready to glaze"
- "For the glaze:  Heat the chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave, stirring until smooth."
- "In a separate large bowl (or mixing bowl) sift the confectioners sugar and ad the corn syrup and hot water. Stirring until smooth. If using a mixer, set on low speed (so the icing doesn&#39;t become too aerated)."
- "Add the melted chocolate to the sugar mixture, then add the vanilla and the coloring (if desired)  If the mixture is too thick to pour, reheat briefly over low heat and stir in a few tablespoons additional water. The mixture is best to work with and will pour smoothly at about 100•F"
- "For glazing: Arrange some  (6-12) of the petit fours onto a metal screen placed on top of a sheet pan. Have the fondant icing glaze heated and ready, then ladle the glaze over the petit fours. Allowing the glaze to drip into the pan below the screen. Once all are covered, use a small metal spatula to move the petit fours from the metal screen to a clean sheet pan lined with parchment. Then, using a spatula or plastic scraper, scrape the excess icing glaze from the drip pan back into the bowl and reheat and add extra water as needed. Repeat this process until all petit fours have been glazed. (You may need to clean the screen occasionally as the glaze will build up as you continue through the process)"

- "3 eggs"
- "120 g dark chocolate  another 100g broke into squares"
- "35 g butter"
- "80 g sugar"
- "1 spoon flour"
- " Butter and flour for coating the ramequin"
- " Raspberry coulis"
- "1 punnet raspberries"
- "1 spoon sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "You can make the coulis ahead of time and the cake mixture too and just cook it when ready to serve. Ideal for dinner parties where you can have it all ready on the side and it cooks in only 10/12 min"
- "In a small pot add the raspberries and the sugar and cook on very low heat for about 10 minutes until the raspberries have become purée"
- "Cut 120 g of chocolate into small pieces and add the butter into a bowl. Let the butter and chocolate to melt into Bain Marie or using the defrost setting on your microwave"
- "In a separate bowl mix the three eggs the sugar and the one spoon of flour and mix well. Add the chocolate and butter mixture to it and mix well. You should have a slightly elastic mixture. You can leave this on the side until ready."
- "When ready have the oven on 180°C. Butter the ramekin and dust with flour. Now pour the chocolate mixture until about a third of the way and stop. Now lay the piece of dark chocolate on top. The chocolate will melt at a different time from the cake leaving the inside of it melted."
- "Cook for about 10 to 12 minutes. If you see a dip on the surface of the cake it means that it’s not quite ready yet and leave it for a minute longer"
- "You should be able to easily remove the cake from the ramekin by sliding a knife on the side and flip the cake onto a plate. You can now serve hot with a bit of raspberry coolly on the side, are used shot glasses for serving and serve the coulis room temperature as the cake is very hot. I forgot to take a picture of the inside but it looks like a cake with a melting middle of chocolate."

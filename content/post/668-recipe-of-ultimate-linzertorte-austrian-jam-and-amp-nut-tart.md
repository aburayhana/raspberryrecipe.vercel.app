recipeingredient:
- "20 cm (8 in) springform or cake pan"
- " Nutty Pastry Dough"
- "125 g Flour"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "1/2 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "pinch ground cloves"
- "1 tsp cocoa powder optional"
- "60 g ground almonds"
- "1 tsp lemon zest"
- "1 egg"
- "75 g sugar"
- "100 g unsalted butter cold"
- " Filling"
- "250-300 g raspberry red current or plum jam pflaumenmus"
- "1 Tbsp rum or other liquor"
- " Milk for brushing on dough"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the flour, ground almonds, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cocoa powder and lemon zest. Pile onto a large working surface and form a well in the middle."
- "Add put chunks of cold butter around the well. Then add the sugar and egg into the well."
- "Using your fingers, start working the egg, sugar and butter into the flour around the well."
- "As the flour gets incorporated and a buttery dough starts to form, pull in more flour into the dough from around the sides."
- "When all the flour is worked in, squeeze the dough tightly together into a ball. Cover with wrap and chill in the fridge for about 1 hour."
- "Grease the cake/springform pan with butter and sprinkle with flour."
- "After chilling, roll out 2/3 dough into a rough round shape for the pan. Press it into the bottom of the pan.  Poke the bottom of the crust several times with a fork."
- "Roll out a little of the remaining dough for the sides of the crust and press it around the sides of the pan to form an even border."
- "Mix the jam with rum and spread in the crust."
- "Roll out the rest of the dough into a sheet and cut into strips for the crisscross pattern across the top. It&#39;s also fun to try shapes like circles and stars :) After you lay out the top, brush some milk over the crust."
- "Preheat oven to 180C/350C.  Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the pastry dough is golden brown and the center is bubbling. (I recommend checking after 20 minutes since ovens can be quite different!). Let cool and then remove from the pan."
- "The cake gets better as it ages, so it will actually taste better if you cover it in aluminum foil and let it set for a couple days! When you&#39;re ready to eat, slice and enjoy!"

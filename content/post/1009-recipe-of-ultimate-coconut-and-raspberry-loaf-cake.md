recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 180C fan/160C gas mark 4. Grease a 900g loaf tin. Beat the butter, sugar and vanilla together until fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time with a little of the flour (this is important as it helps stop the mixture splitting)."

- "Bake for 35 minutes, cover and return to the oven for another 20-25 minutes until just cooked and just golden. (You might need to adjust the times for your oven, I had to cover mine after 20 minutes because the top was cooking too quickly)."
- "Leave to cool. Mix together the icing ingredients, drizzle the icing over the cake and sprinkle the coconut on top."

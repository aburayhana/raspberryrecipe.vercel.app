recipeingredient:
- "1 Cup Flour"
- "1/2 Teaspoon Baking Soda"
- "1/2 Teaspoon Baking Powder"
- "1/4 Teaspoon Salt"
- "1/2 Cup Unsalted Butter"
- "2/3 Cup Sugar"
- "1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract"
- "1 Egg"
- "1/2 Cup Buttermilk"
- "1.5 Cups Raspberries Fresh"
recipeinstructions:
- "Butter a 9-inch round cake pan and dust with flour (to avoid the cake sticking to the pan)."
- "Preheat oven to 400 Fahrenheit."
- "Whisk all the ingredients under the &#34;flour mixture&#34; in a large bowl and keep it aside. Make sure that all the ingredients are well incorporated."
- "Take another bowl and beat the sugar and butter with a cake mixer till creamy. Add the vanilla to the mixture and beat again. Add the egg and beat again."
- "Put the mixer on low speed and add the flour mixture and buttermilk alternatively, starting and ending with buttermilk. The low speed is to avoid the flour mixture forming a cloud of flour dust and covering you and the table around you."
- "The consistency of the cake batter will be creamy and thick. Now scrape out the batter into the pan and then top it with your favorite berries."
- "Bake for about 20-25 mins till golden brown and till an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Do not overbake as the cake will burn and be dry."
- "Let the cake cool for about 15 mins in the pan to avoid it from sticking to the pan when removed. Once cooled invert the cake to your favorite cake stand/display. The pics are from using a 9 inch spring foam pan (hence the cake was not inverted)."
- "Enjoy with your family and friends!"

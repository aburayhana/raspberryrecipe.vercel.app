recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare two 18 cm, 1.5 cm thick sponge cakes. Use your desired cake mold, but if you don&#39;t have one, see the next step."
- "Fold up the corners of a sheet of kitchen parchment paper to make a square sheet a little larger than an 18 cm circlular mold (about 20 cm square). Make 2."
- "Combine the eggs and sugar in a bowl and beat while heating over a double boiler. When the egg mixture becomes warm to the touch, remove from the double boiler and beat until thick."
- "Add the sifted dry ingredients and mix until no longer powdery. Drizzle in the melted butter and stir until just combined."
- "Pour half of the batter into each of the two pans, spreading to an even thickness. Bake in an oven preheated at 190°C for about 12 minutes."
- "Remove the cooled sponge cakes from the kitchen parchment paper and cut to the same size as the circular mold."
- "Make the syrup. Dissolve the sugar into the water, then add the Kirsch once cooled."
- "Make the mousse. Chop up the chocolate and melt in a double boiler. Soak the gelatin in cold water."
- "Bring the milk to a boil and add the chocolate a little at a time while stirring carefully with a rubber spatula. Stir in the gelatin while warm to dissolve."
- "Combine the egg white and sugar in a separate bowl and beat until stiff peaks form to make the meringue."
- "Add the heavy cream and sugar in a separate bowl and beat until thickened. Mix 1/3 of it into the cooled Step 9, then mix in the remaining 2/3."
- "Add Step 11&#39;s meringue and mix until evenly combined to complete the mousse. Put into a pastry bag with a 1~1.2 cm round tip."
- "Place one layer of the sponge cake into the cake mold or circle and use a brush to coat with half of the syrup. Lightly squeeze a thin layer of the mouse on top of the syrup."
- "Line the edge of the cake mold with strawberries cut in half, cut side facing out. Arrange whole strawberries in the center of the cake. This time, I used 29 strawberries for an 18 cm cake."
- "Note: I filled the inside of the cake with strawberries, but you can also leave the very center open if you like, to make cutting easier."
- "This time, I used a package of strawberries that had 27 small strawberries per pack. I removed the hulls and cut them all to be 3 cm high."
- "Fill in all the gaps between the strawberries with the mousse."
- "Add enough mousse to cover the strawberries, but leave a little bit in the bag for covering the top of the cake. Top with the other sponge cake layer, crust-side down, and brush with the remaining syrup."
- "Spread the remaining mousse on top of the sponge cake in a thin layer and smooth the surface with a palette knife. Chill in the refrigerator for a few hours."
- "Mix together the nappage (the type that doesn&#39;t require adding hot water) and raspberry jam (strained) and spread on the cake&#39;s surface to finish."
- "If making a 15 cm cake, the strawberries will look like this. I used about 21~22 small strawberries."
- "No matter how you cut it, it will be full of strawberries. The white chocolate and tart strawberries work so well together. The mousse is light, so you can gobble it all up."
- "If using a 5 cm high circular mold, cut the sponge cake to 1 cm thick."

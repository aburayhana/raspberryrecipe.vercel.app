- "Cut the baked cake. First, cut the cake at 18 cm from the bottom. Then, cut the bigger piece in half. You will now have 3 pieces. You will use the bottom two pieces."
- "From each of the two shorter sides of the rectangular cake, slice off the edges at 45° angles (see Step 12 for more details). Spread cream thickly on the surface of the cake. You&#39;ll use the rest of the cream later."
- "Fold the cake into a tear-shape. Bring the two ends together neatly. They should fit well because of the diagonal slices you made earlier to the edges."
- "Make the other half of the cake the same way.  Wrap the cakes in plastic wrap (or something similar) and place in the fridge."

- "Cut the other cake the same way. Put the two halves together."
- "Use the remaining cream like glue to stick the two halves together. Arrange the heart shape by making sure that the cut edges are aligned correctly."
- "Wrap the cake in plastic wrap (or something similar), and let it rest in the fridge for a while."
- "Once the cake has chilled well, slice off the rough ends for a clean cross-section on both sides. Portion out the rest of the cake into whatever sized pieces you like."
- "It&#39;s finished. ♪"
- "Postscript. When making the diagonal cut in Step 3, slice off the edges of the cake at 45° angles as shown in the picture. After cutting both ends like this, the tear shape should be easy to make."

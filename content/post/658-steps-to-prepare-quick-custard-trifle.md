- "2 packs Raspberry Jelly pieces"
- "2 Vanilla cakes small packet store bought"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the custard by boiling milk at first. After it comes to a rolling boil, simmer it on a low heat until 20 minutes. After the stipulated time, take out some of the milk about half a cup in a bowl and stir in the custard powder until lump free."
- "Now add this back to the simmering milk along with the condensed milk and keep stirring. Increase the heat to a high and keep stirring until desired thickness is attained. Take it off the heat. Let it cool down."
- "Chill this prepared custard in the refrigerator for an ample amount of time. Also set some Jello out of the store bought packs of your favourite flavours according to the package instructions."
- "Cut the fruits into bite size pieces and assemble this trifle just before serving. It should be kept in mind otherwise the presence of some fruits can make the custard watery. So use only Bananas and Apples for this one as I did."
- "In a serving bowl or shot glasses, arrange the cake pieces. Top that with the fruit layer. Finally top it up with the thick custard layer and the Jello pieces. Or else make it in a big serving dish and it will have similar 3 layers. The choice is all yours."
- "Enjoy it chilled!"

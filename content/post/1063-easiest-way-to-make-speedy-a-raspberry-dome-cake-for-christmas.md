recipeinstructions:

- "Make the spongecake. Place the eggs and granulated sugar into a bowl and place in a hot water bath, mix with a hand mixer at high speed for 3 minutes, remove from the hot water bath for 2 minutes, and whip at low speed for 1 minute. Stick a toothpick 1 cm in, and once it can stand in the meringue without falling, it&#39;s done."

- "Make the bavarois. Put the powdered gelatin in water and let it soak. Add milk and granulated sugar to a saucepan, heat  until it&#39;s almost boiling, and dissolve the granulated sugar. Remove from the heat, add to the gelatin liquid, and dissolve."
- "Blend the Step 6 mixture and the raspberries in a blender until smooth."
- "Put the Step 7 mixture in a bowl and cool it over ice. Thicken while mixing with a whisk. Add the heavy cream, and mix well. Pass the mixture through a strainer."
- "Pour the Step 8 mixture into the mold from Step 5. Chill in the refrigerator for more than 3 hours to let it set. After it has set, cover the top with the remaining sponge cake."
- "Decorate the cake. Carefully unmold the set cake from Step 9 onto a plate. Mix granulated sugar and heavy cream together and whip until soft peaks form. Cover the surface of the cake with the cream using a palette knife."
- "Decorate with fruit and so on."
- "Slice carefully..."
- "This is what the cross section looks like!"
- "This is the 35% heavy cream I used."

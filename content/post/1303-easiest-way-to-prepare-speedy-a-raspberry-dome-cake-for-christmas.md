Using this ribbon as a guide for length and a ruler for depth, roll out a thin strip of the remaining pink sugar paste. It blends together both lemon juice and zest for a sweet cake with bold lemon flavor that pairs beautifully with the raspberry whipped cream that gets piled on top. Raspberry cake filling: If you don&#39;t wish to make the filling from scratch you could use a can of raspberry cake filling. (I prefer the Solo brand). My family loved it so much they asked me to make it, just one week later, for Christmas.

recipeinstructions:
- "Make the ice cream cake : Brush a 3-quart metal bowl with veg oil, line with plastic wrap.

Place a piece of plastic wrap on the top of the ice cream, press down to close the gaps between and even out the surface.

- "Freeze it about 30 min.

- "Now remove the top layer of the plastic wrap, then invert the cake onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Remove the rest of the plastic wrap and cover the ice cream completely with the meringue, making the dome-shapped too slightly thicker than the sides. Form swirly peaks in the meringue using the back of the spoon. Freeze for at least 3 more hrs."
- "Preheat the oven at 500°,bake the cake until the meringue peaks are golden, about 4 min or brown the meringue with a blow torch."
- "Let the cake soften at room temperature for 5-10 min before serving."

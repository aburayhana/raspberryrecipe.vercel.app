- "1 tablespoon maple syrup"
- "2 tablespoons chia seeds"
- "7 tablespoons water"
recipeinstructions:
- "IN ADVANCE: Soak the cashew nuts in water for at least an hour (several hours or even overnight is fine too). Drain them before use (you will use them in the top layer)."
- "BASE LAYER: Use a food processor to grind the almonds down to a meal. It&#39;s fine if this meal is a little rustic with tiny pieces, rather than finely ground."
- "Add the vanilla extract and maple syrup until everything comes together. This mixture should stick together nicely between your fingers when pressed."
- "Line a round tin or container with parchment paper and compact the mixture down very firmly to create a &#39;crust&#39; base layer. Pop it in the fridge whilst you make the next layer."
- "TOPPING: Finely chop the creamed coconut. Pop all of the ingredients into the food processor and blend thoroughly until there are no pieces and everything is evenly combined."
- "Spread the top layer on evenly."
- "Pop it in the freezer for at least an hour. If you have time, then leave it for a few hours so it firms up really well and slices nicely."
- "SAUCE (OPTIONAL): Blend all the sauce ingredients together and pop in the fridge or simply leave on your kitchen counter."
- "The chia seeds will start to expand and act as a gelling agent over the next half hour. Stir two or three times during this period."
- "TO SERVE: Take out of the freezer, slice with a sharp, heavy knife."
- "Pour or dollop on some of the raspberry chia sauce if desired."
- "Allow a few minutes before eating (to soften it a little, since it&#39;s just come out of the freezer)."
- "This keeps well for a couple of months in the freezer."

- " For Ice Cream Cake"
- "1 pint raspberry passion fruit or other sorbet softened"
- "1 pint vanilla ice cream softened"
- "1 quart chocolate ice cream softened"

- "1 loaf pound cake"
- "as needed Veg oil for brushing"

- "1 cup egg white"
- "1 pinch cream of tartar"

recipeinstructions:
- "Make the ice cream cake : Brush a 3-quart metal bowl with veg oil, line with plastic wrap. Fill the bowl with scoops of the sorbet,vanilla ice cream and half of the chocolate ice cream, alternating small and large scoops to create a mosaic of colors and shapes. Place a piece of plastic wrap on the top of the ice cream, press down to close the gaps between and even out the surface. Remove the plastic wrap, sprinkle the ice cream with the wafer crumbs and re-cover with the plastic wrap."
- "Freeze it about 30 min. Remove the wrap and spread the remaining chocolate ice cream in an even layer on the top of the crumbs, cut the pound cake into 1/2 inch slices, completely cover the ice cream with the slices, trimming as needed. Cover with fresh plastic wrap and freeze until firm at least 2 hrs."
- "Make the Meringue : Whip the egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl with a mixer on high speed until foamy, about 2 min. Gradually beat in the sugar in high speed until the whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks."
- "Now remove the top layer of the plastic wrap, then invert the cake onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Remove the rest of the plastic wrap and cover the ice cream completely with the meringue, making the dome-shapped too slightly thicker than the sides. Form swirly peaks in the meringue using the back of the spoon. Freeze for at least 3 more hrs."
- "Preheat the oven at 500°,bake the cake until the meringue peaks are golden, about 4 min or brown the meringue with a blow torch."
- "Let the cake soften at room temperature for 5-10 min before serving."
